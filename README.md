## 📋 Project Overview

This project involves designing and assembling a traditional LEGO minifigure from scratch using SolidWorks. Each component is modeled as a separate part and then assembled to create the complete figure, mimicking the real-world construction of LEGO minifigures.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **Part Modeling**: Practice creating individual components with proper dimensions and features
- **Assembly Design**: Learn to mate and constrain parts in a multi-component assembly
- **Feature Mirroring**: Master techniques for creating symmetric parts (left/right arms and legs)
- **Design Intent**: Understand how to build models that are easy to modify and maintain

## 🔧 Components Included

- **Head**: Classic cylindrical head with stud connection
- **Torso**: Main body piece with arm attachment points
- **Arms**: Left and right arms (mirrored from single design)
- **Hands**: Detachable hand pieces with C-clip grip
- **Hips**: Lower torso connection piece
- **Legs**: Left and right legs (mirrored design)
- **Assembly**: Complete minifigure assembly with proper mates

## 📐 Technical Details

- **Software**: SolidWorks (compatible with 2020 and newer)
- **Units**: Millimeters (mm)
- **Scale**: Approximately 1:1 to actual LEGO minifigure dimensions
- **File Structure**: Individual parts + main assembly file
- **Features Used**: Extrudes, revolves, sweeps, fillets, chamfers, mirrors, patterns

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- SolidWorks 2020 or newer
- Basic understanding of SolidWorks interface

### Opening the Project
1. Download all files to a local folder
2. Open the main assembly file: `Assem1.SLDASM`
3. SolidWorks will automatically load all referenced part files
4. Explore individual parts by opening `.SLDPRT` files

## 💡 Key Learning Points

### Mirroring Techniques
This project demonstrates several mirroring approaches:
- **Mirror Features**: Creating symmetric geometry within a single part
- **Mirror Parts**: Generating opposite-hand parts from a master design
- **Assembly Mirroring**: Creating mirrored components at the assembly level

### Design Best Practices
- Proper use of reference planes and sketches
- Maintaining design intent through feature relationships
- Efficient modeling techniques for symmetric parts
- Assembly constraints that allow for realistic movement

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

- **Different Poses**: Modify assembly mates to create various poses
- **Accessories**: Add tools or other LEGO accessories
- **Scaling**: Resize the entire model for different applications
- **Materials**: Apply different materials and appearances
- **Animation**: Create simple animations showing assembly/disassembly

## 📚 Skills Developed

- Part modeling fundamentals
- Assembly design and mating
- Feature mirroring and patterning
- File management in multi-part projects
- Design for manufacturing concepts
- 3D visualization and presentation
